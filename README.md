# evtxscanner

Powershell script to scan Windows eventlog with Sigma rules. This doesn't include all Sigma rules but the ones that are most effective.

All conditions included from Florian Roth's Godmode Sigma rule: https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/other/godmode_sigma_rule.yml

Some additional rules also included which I found important. Might add some more later!
